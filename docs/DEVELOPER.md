👍🎉 Hi Developers, again, thanks for contributing to TCC. 👍🎉 . You can follow the guidance below to start your developer journey.

# Set up

### Step 1: Fork The Repository

Forking repository gives your own space to customize the code and be able to create pull requests to our main branch easily.

### Step 2: Switch To Development Environment
You can switch by `switch_dev_prod_mode.sh`. This helps you to take the advantage of `config_development.yaml` under `tools/training_model/{model_name}/config` (and other mechanisms built for easy development), where you can try your own model configuration. We recommend you to use simpler model so that you can spend less time on model trainings.
