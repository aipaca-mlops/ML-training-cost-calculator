# Depends On Who You Are

<!-- TODO: post a place where people can submit and download training data -->

If you are a developer, you can contribute to the data generation pipeline. Check [DEVELOPER.md](docs/DEVELOPER.md) for more details.

If you are a researcher, you can download our training data and contribute to the TCC model.

# Open a Bug Report

If you are facing a general problem, we encourage you to open an [issue](https://github.com/aipaca-mlops/ML-training-cost-calculator/issues) so that future community members can view a well-organized history.

If you are facing a personal problem, you can always send Aipaca's Admin Team a direct message from [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/bYB7EuXzWW).

# Triaging a Bug Report

It is common for open issues to involve discussion. Some contributors may have differing opinions, including whether the behavior is a bug or feature. This discussion is part of the process and should be kept focused, helpful, and professional.

Terse responses that provide neither additional context nor supporting detail are not helpful or professional. To many, such responses are annoying and unfriendly.

Contributors are encouraged to solve issues collaboratively and help one another make progress. If you encounter an issue that you feel is invalid, or which contains incorrect information, explain why you feel that way with additional supporting context, and be willing to be convinced that you may be wrong. By doing so, we can often reach the correct outcome faster.

# Pull Requests

Pull Requests are the way concrete changes are made to the code, documentation, dependencies, and tools contained in the ``aipaca-mlops/ML-training-cost-calculator`` repository.

# Languages

We accept issues in any language. When an issue is posted in a language besides English, it is acceptable and encouraged to post an English-translated copy as a reply. Anyone may post the translated reply. In most cases, a quick pass through translation software is sufficient. Having the original text as well as the translation can help mitigate translation errors.

Responses to posted issues may or may not be in the original language.

# Improvement

We understand some contribution details have not been standardized. We planned to gradually fulfill it according to our contributor habits in the future.
