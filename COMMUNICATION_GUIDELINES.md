### Enforcing to the code of conduct

Our [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) outlines the behavior we expect from our community. Maintainers are responsible for enforcing violations they witness, or those that have been reported to hello@aipaca.ai.

Violations are not tolerated, but there are always some gray areas.

- **Indirect violations or gray areas** can usually be addressed with a warning. Send the user a direct message if possible (say, if they're on our Slack instance). If the violation occurred in an issue, pull request, or other public space, you should respond publicly as well. It is important that all community members see violations are not tolerated.
- **Direction violations** require action immediately. This may include removing an offensive comment, [blocking the user](https://help.github.com/articles/blocking-a-user-from-your-organization/) from our organization, and [reporting them to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/reporting-abuse-or-spam/) directly.
